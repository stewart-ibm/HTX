HTX User Manual
===============

1.0 Overview

	The Hardware Test Executive (HTX) is a suite of test tools for hardware
	validation of OpenPOWER system. The HTX stress tests the system by exercising
	all or selected hardware components concurrently to uncover any hardware
	design flaws and hardware-hardware or hardware-software interaction issues.
	The HTX consists of test programs (a.k.a exercisers) to test processor, memory
	and IO subsystem of POWER system. The HTX runs on PowerKVM guests (Linux 
	distributions like Ubuntu, SuSE and Redhat), and OPAL-based Linux distributions
	(like Ubuntu) and on Linux host machine. HTX supports two types of control
	interfaces to exercisers, user interactive and command line.

1.1 Obtaining and building HTX source 

	HTX source can be downloaded from Github (https://github.com/open-power/HTX).
	To build HTX source, please refer, <HTX source>/Documentation/building_htx.txt.

1.2 Setting up the System to Install HTX 

	Make sure that the following conditions are satisfied before you install the HTX: 

	• The /tmp directory must have a few gigabytes of free disk space because the
		HTX logs are saved in that directory. 
	• The minimum system memory that is required per logical processor is 1 GB. 
	• The swap space on the test system is enabled according to operating system norms. 
	• The optical media drives to be tested have appropriate test media (for example
		CD or DVD-ROM). 
	• The HTX test machine environment (for e.g. glibc) and HTX build machine
		environment should be similar if not exactly same.

1.3 Installing HTX 

	HTX images can be built in .rpm or .deb format depending upon the Linux
	distribution. First, uninstall the existing version of HTX, if one exists,
	and then install the new version. 

	1.3.1 Installing an HTX RPM Package 

		To install an HTX RPM package, do the following steps: 

		1. Log in as root. 
		2. Check if HTX is installed on your test system: 
			rpm -qa | grep "^htx" 

			a. If HTX is not installed, go to step 3. Otherwise, uninstall it: 
			rpm -e <htx package name> 

			b. Verify that directory /usr/lpp/htx no longer exists: 
			ls -al /usr/lpp/htx 
			
			c. Remove directory /usr/lpp/htx if it still exists: 
			rm -rf /usr/lpp/htx 

			3. Install the latest RPM package for your system: 
			rpm -ivh <rpmfilename> 

	1.3.2 Installing an HTX .deb Package 

		To install an HTX .dep package, do the following steps: 

		1. Log in as root. 
		2. Check if HTX is installed on your test system: 
			dpkg --list "htx*" 
			a. If HTX Linux is not installed, go to step 3. Otherwise, uninstall it: 
				dpkg -r <htx package name> 

			b. Verify that directory /usr/lpp/htx no longer exists: 
				ls -al /usr/lpp/htx 
			c. Remove directory /usr/lpp/htx if it still exists: 
				rm -rf /usr/lpp/htx 
		3. Install the latest HTX .deb package for your system: 
			dpkg -i <HTX debfilename> 

1.4 Running HTX

	HTX has two interfaces to manage the execution part, user interactive menu
	driven option and automation friendly command line option. Menu driven HTX
	run options are detailed below. Command line options are described in detail
	in another document (htx_cmdline_cmds.txt).
	
	Steps to start HTX with menu:
	1. Login as user htx on system under test. During this step HTX detects the
		hardware configuration on system under test and creates MDT files.
		#su - htx
	2. Lanuch HTX
		# htx
		During this step, one needs to supply the name of MDT file to run.
		HTX then presents a main menu.
	
	Folloing are the options available on user interactive main menu:
	 
	Activate/Halt HTX Supervisor (option 1). 
		A toggle switch that activates or halts all the hardware exercisers
		that are defined in the master device table (MD)T file. 

	Activate/Halt Device(s) (option 2) 
		Activates or halts individual devices. This option opens another page
		where you can choose the individual exerciser to activate or halt. 

	Set Run Type (REG/EMC) (option 3) 
		Toggles between EMC1 and REG mode. You cannot use this option after the
		supervisor is started with option 1. Each device has a unique rule file
		for each mode. (EMC mode is deprecated.)  
 
	Show/Set/Clear “Continue on Error” Flag(s) for Device(s) (option 4) 
		Sets up individual devices to stop-on-error (SOE) or continue-on-error
		(COE). This option opens another screen where you can set the SOE or
		COE flag of each exerciser. 
 
	Display Device Status Table (option 5) 
		Opens the HTX status table. This table is explained in detail in Section
		4.1.3 HTX Status Page (Option 5) on page 25. 
 
	Display Device Statistics (option 6) 
		Displays the device statistics file (/tmp/htxstats). This file contains
		the performance information of all the running exercisers. 
		
	Edit HTX Error Log (option 7) 
		Opens the HTX error log (/tmp/htxerr). If an exerciser experiences an
		error, a corresponding error information entry is made in this file. 

	Edit HTX Message Log (option 8) 
		Displays the HTX message log (/tmp/htxmsg). All of the important
		information from the exerciser runs is logged in this file. 

	Edit Master Device Table (MDT) (option 9) 
		Displays the currently running master device table. 

	Add Device/Restart or Terminate Exercisers (option 10) 
		Opens the Add/Restart/Terminate Device page. 

	Go to shell command line (option 11) 
		Opens to the shell command line temporarily. (Type exit to return to the main menu.)
		
	To refer to commend options available with command line control program (htxcmdline),
	please refer to htxd_user_manual.txt file in Documentation dir.

	
	MDT (Machine Device Table) and Rule File :
	------------------------------------------
	MDT is the text file that contains the list of devices that can be tested by the HTX. 
	Each block (except the default block) inside the MDT file contains device names
	(pseudo or real), associated exercisers, and a rule file. The rule file is a collection
	of test cases (rules). The default block contains MDT parameters that are applicable to
	all devices that are present in the MDT file. However, a particular parameter value
	can be overridden by specifying a new value in a device-specific block. 

	HTX setup scripts detect devices that can be tested by the HTX on the system under test.
	The scripts create the mdt.all file in the /usr/lpp/htx/mdt directory. 

	Various other MDT files are derived from the mdt.all file and are placed in the 
	/usr/lpp/htx/mdt directory. Each MDT file is a plain text file and can be viewed and
	modified by any text editor. An asterisk (*) works as a line comment character for this
	file. You must leave at least one blank line between the blocks in the MDT file as a
	syntax requirement. To run the HTX, one of the available MDT files must be supplied to
	start the test. 

	The rule file is a text file that is a collection of rules (test cases). Each rule
	contains various test parameters, called rule parameters. Rule parameters are defined
	by each exerciser and are specific to that exerciser. All rule files for a particular
	exerciser can be found in the /usr/lpp/htx/rules/reg/<exerciser name>/ directory. 
	For more information about each rule parameter, see the exerciser readme file at 
	/usr/lpp/htx/rules/reg/<exerciser name>/ directory. The naming convention for a readme
	file is <exerciser name>.readme.

		Please note that certain exercisers are not suitable to run in PowerKVM
	guest or PowerVM shared LPAR environment. These exerciser entries would not be
	present in mdt files. Its not a bug. Also some devices may not pass HTX
	testability check and hence they would not show up in MDT files (for e.g.
	hard disk partition with any file system on it).
	
	HTX Log Files
	-------------
	HTX Error Log:
	All HTX exercisers log errors in a common file. By default its /tmp/htxerr file.
	
	HTX Message Log:
	All HTX exercisers log messages in a common file. By default its /tmp/htxmsg file.
	
	HTX Statistics Log:
	All HTX exercisers log their run time stats in /tmp/htxstats file.
	
	HTX Start/Stop Time:
	Start of test and enf of test (Date and time stamp) are captured in
	/tmp/htx.start.stop.time file.
	
	HTX Setup Scripts Log:
	/tmp/HTXScreenOutput file captures log of HTX setup scripts execution. This will be
	handy while debugging.
	
	Network setup
	-------------
	Network setup for HTX network exerciser (hxecom) is captured in separate document,
	network_setup_procedure.txt file.
	
	Customizing MDT Files
	---------------------	
	The interactive script, create_my_mdt, helps you to create an MDT that
	has devices and a rule file name that you choose. Run this script after
	you log in as user HTX (su - htx) before you run the htx command. 

	Example: /usr/lpp/htx% create_my_mdt 

	How do you want to create your own mdt file: 
	With devices of your choice from mdt.all: 1 
	Without devices of your choice from mdt.all: 2 
	Note: Chosen devices are selected (if option 1) or dropped (if option 2)
	from the mdt.all file when you create a new MDT file of your choice. 

	Enter 1 or 2: 1 

	For device names that are used by HTX and their availability on this system,
	look in the mdt.all file in the /usr/lpp/htx/mdt/ directory. 

	Enter device names, separated by space only: sctu fpu fpscr 

	The mdt files already present in /usr/lpp/htx/mdt/ directory mdt mdt.bsr mdt.io mdt.mem 
	mdt.readme mdt.tlbie mdt_net mdt.all mdt.bsr.mem mdt.cpu mdt.loopback mdt.misc mdt.sctu 
	mdt.trace_cpu net.default 

	Enter new mdt file name: mdt.test 

	Creating new mdt file: mdt.test with devices: sctu fpu fpscr 
	After the completion of this command, a new file with the name mdt.test is
	created in the /usr/lpp/htx/mdt directory. This MDT file has device entries
	for SCTU, floating-point unit (FPU), and floating-point status control unit
	(FPSCR) devices only. 

	If you choose option 2 initially, the MDT that is created has all the
	devices present in the mdt.all file other than the ones that you specify
	when you run the create_my_mdt script. 

2.0	HTX Features

	2.1 Bootme tests
		Bootme are reboot tests. User can configure system under test to reboot at
		regular interval and restart HTX test automatically. Please refer to bootme
		documentation in <TOPDIR>/rules/reg/bootme dir.
		
	2.2 Equaliser
		By default HTX exercisers are run uncapped and in a free flowing manner.
		However, if user wants to run certain exercisers in more orchestrated manner,
		Equaliser is the feature to use. More details about how to enable and configure
		Equaliser is captured in <TOPDIR>/Documentation/equaliser.readme.
		
3.0 List of HTX Exercisers and their brief description
	hxefpu64 >
		Objective: To test VSU (Vector Scalar Unit) of power processors by
		generating pseudo random sequence of instructions.

		Major features:

			Supports testing of BFP, DFP, VMX, VSX instructions
			Supports both correctness and consistency checking
			Supports CPU thread specific instructions biasing and FP data corners biasing (number line)
			Capable of generating test instructions throughput of few MIPS
			Seed based test case recreation ability
			Supports creation and execution of a macro to focus on hand coded list of instructions
			In case of miscompare, exerciser generates detailed miscompare report
			At the end of test execution, provides instructions coverage report

		Points to ponder:

			hxefpu64 exer creates one device entry in mdt file per processor core.
			For each such device there will be a corresponding hxefpu64 process when
			you kick off mdt file. htxconf.awk script finds out the available processor
			cores in system using lsdev command and creates fpuXX device for each core.
			In case of miscompare, hxefpu64 exer would create a detailed miscompare log
			file, log an error in HTX error log and continues to run.

	hxecpu >

		Objective: To test power processor core by generating pseudo random sequence of instructions.

		Major features:

			Supports testing of most user mode instructions
			Supports consistency checking
			Supports CPU thread specific instructions biasing and FP data corners biasing (number line)
			Capable of generating test instructions throughput of few MIPS
			Seed based test case recreation ability

		Points to ponder:

			hxecpu exer creates one device entry in mdt file per processor core.
			For each such device there will be a corresponding hxecpu process
			when you kick off mdt file. htxconf.awk script finds out the available
			processor cores in system using lsdev command and creates cpuXX device
			for each core.
			In case of miscompare, hxecpu exer would create a detailed miscompare
			log file, log an error in HTX error log and continues to run.

		 
	hxesctu >

		Objective: To test processor cache coherency of Power system

		Major features:

			Hits at false shared cache line from upto 8 cpu threads to stress cache coherency logic
			Supports CPU thread specific instructions biasing
			Capable of generating testcase using most user mode power processor instructions
			Seed based test case recreation ability


		Points to ponder:

			hxesctu expects affinity between vcpus and pcpus (dedicated mode LPAR config)
			for effective testing. Hence, in shared config mode (both PowerVM and PowerKVM)
			sctu is not included in default mdt.
			hxesctu is required to be cpu hungry due to the fact that it runs upto 8 software
			threads on 8 distinct hardware threads in parallel and expects all of them to
			be present on respective cpu at a same time while executing a testcase. Under
			heavily loaded system when other cpu bound exers are also contending, it causes
			sctu to run slow. Hence, sctu software threads' priority is bumped up while
			running testcase and is brought down when done with testcase execution.
			HTX setup script creates N sctu copies per SCTU gang (upto 8 cores), where N is
			SMT value configured on system. Each sctu copy creates upto 8 threads for
			testcase execution and each thread would pick a cpu thread from cores of gang.

	hxemem64 >

		Objective: To stress test memory subsystem of power system.

		Major features:

			Can test large amount of system real memory by allocating it through OS shared memory and performing WRC ops on available memory.
			Supports variety of patterns (data pattern through file, immediate pattern, special patterns)
			Can test all available and configured physical page sizes and segment sizes
			Supports various test operations on memory segments (sequential access, cache line hoping, any size hoping)
			Support multiple threads
			Support testing L4 cahce

		Points to ponder:
		
	hxecache >

		Objetive: To stress test L1/L2/L3 caches

		Major features:

			Has L2/L3 rollover tests and L2 cache line bouncing test
			Can run various prefetch irritators alongside cache tests.
			Supports basic, transient, N stride, Partial prefetch types
			Rule file tunable to avoid using specified chiplet(s) to indirectly test dynamic ECO
			Prefetch threads randomizes DSCR fields

	hxefabricbus >

		Objective: To maximize address/data traffic on intra node and inter node fabric buses

		Major features:

			Intra node links test
			Inter node links test
			Supports various data patterns to be sent over links
			Allows to hand code processor/memory mappings to customize stress on links

		Points to ponder:

			Should be run alone for maximum effectiveness
			Does not make much sense to run on LPAR with shared processors configuration and KVM guests
			Execiser readme is present in /usr/lpp/htx/rules/reg/hxefabricbus/hxefabricbus.readme on all test machines installed with HTX.

	hxestorage >

		Objective: To test storage subsystem by using end devices as target.

		Major features:

			Performs raw mode storage ops with data integrity checks on variety of storage devices ( LV, RAID, JBOD, SAN, Flash/HDD, Dynamic Tiers, DVDRAM)
			Multiple threads with capability to control write/read ratio Tunables for transfer length, random/seq access ratio, buffer alignment
			Metadata for each LBA to isolate data integrity issues
			Separate performance and validation coverage modes

		Points to ponder:

			hxestorage would not test a device which has file system configured
			Execiser readme is present in /usr/lpp/htx/rules/reg/hxestorage/hxestorage.readme on all test machines installed with HTX.	
			
	hxecom/hxedapl >

		Objective: To test network subsystem

		Majot features:

			Uses TCP sockets or RDMA constructs to generate traffic on eithernet, RoCE, IB, RNIC or CNA adapters
			Supports testing of network interfaces within single system or across multiple systems
			Can be configured to create multiple senders/receivers
			Packet data (application payload) generated are context aware which helps isolate data integrity issues
			Supports performance mode (optimized buffer use and data patterns)
			Can auto detect looped back network interfaces on single system and auto configures them for testing

		Points to ponder:
			Execiser readme is present in /usr/lpp/htx/rules/reg/hxecom/hxecom.readme on all test machines installed with HTX.

	hxecorsa >

		Objective: To perform stress test on Corsa GZIP adapter by issuing deflate/inflate and bypass operations.

		Major Features:

			Operations: deflate/inflate/compare, deflate/deflate/compare, bypass
			Multithreaded
			Various data patterns

		Points to Ponder:
			Currently supported on HTX AIX (all versions) and HTX-Linux (RHEL only).

	Equalizer >

		Objective:
		Default HTX run would run all exercisers full blown without any restrictions or
		control. If exercisers are to be run in a controlled manner with specific
		exerciser to processor thread affinity then Equalizer should be used. Equalizer
		would allow exercisers to be run according to a utilization pattern specified
		in Equalizer config file.

		Major features:

			It supports deterministic start/stop of workload (following HTX ecercisers):
				hxefpu64 - floating point test program.
				hxecache - cache stress program
				hxemem64 - memory stress program
				hxecpu - generic cpu exercsier.
			Specialised rule file for each supported exerciser.
			A config file "/usr/lpp/htx/htx_eq.cfg" is provided to configure the equaliser.
			Provides finer control over workload.
			Processor utilization can be controlled through a bit mask or through predefined patterns.
			Affinity control at processor hardware thread level.

	htxd >

		Objective:
		This is a new and state-of-the-art HTX daemon which will replace current STX eservd.
		The htxd automatically starts as a service on system boot or HTX install. htxcmdline
		is a new command line (replacing esrv) utility that can start sending commands to
		control HTX run on system under test without having a need to get onto system under
		test. htxcmdline is backward compatible with esrv and hence all the automation scripts
		written with STX should run as-is with new htxd.
