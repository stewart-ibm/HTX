/*
 * NAME: main()
 *
 * This is a sample HTX hardware exerciser program to show how to interface
 * with HTX.
 *
 * This is the minimum required to be able to run under the HTX Supervisor.
 *
 * This exerciser can be invoked by either the HTX supervisor or directly from
 * the command line to bypass communicating with the HTX Supervisor (e.g.
 * run in "stand-alone" mode).
 *
 * To run in "stand-alone" mode simply enter the following command:
 * hxesamp /dev/samp OTH
 *
 * Since argv[2] is OTH, the hxfupdate() functions calls will not try to
 * communicate with the HTX supervisor using IPC shared memory functions, and
 * any messages put out using hxfmsg() will be written to either "stdout" or
 * "stderr" rather than being sent to HTX using IPC msg send/msg receive.
 *
 * If the message severity code is <=6, the message will got to stderr, if >=7
 * stdout.
 *
 * This allows the exerciser to be tested without interfacing with the
 * HTX supervisor.
 *
 * When the HTX Supervisor invokes the exerciser, it supplies arg[1] /dev/samp,
 * argv[2] run_type (REG or EMC), and optionally argv[3] a file path name
 * containing input parameters.
 *
 * argv[1], argv[2], and argv[3] come from the htx master device table (MDT).
 *
 * The run_type is determined from HTX main menu option 3.
 *
 * Normally the device to be exercised is passed to the exerciser in argv[1]
 * thus allowing the same exerciser to run multiple devices, however any
 * unique string can be used. This sample exerciser uses "samp".
